# Covid__Care
In the era of covid-19, most of us are very concerned about our safety and well-being. We are being extra cautious about our surroundings and anything that exposes us to this highly contagious virus. This can be quite anxiety inducing. 
The app that we will build will help us keep track of the current situation of covid-19 and help us combat it. If we know enough information about the status of the virus around us and throughout the world. It will track the high-risk areas so that we can avoid them.
It will also help with our personal well-being because this app will provide with health tips and if infected with covid, assist in many way.
The app will have features like infection tracker, nearest sample collection location, isolation tracker, covid updates etc. We will use Reactnative for user interface,
Rest API for backend (Node JS), and COVID API for Covid-19 data
